# Acoustics Windows Utilities

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2010 project for a Windows utility to show the currently playing song for an Acoustics instance and control playback.

This is a work-in-progress. Nothing is guaranteed about it working.

## Requirements

You need to have the Windows 7 toolbar .net wrapper library somewhere. You will also need json.NET (Newtonsoft). I haven't included them here because that's bad form and I'll have a compiled version of this up somewhere eventually.
